# To-Do List
- Write a home page greeting the user
- Improve CSS in messages page
    - fixed display showing what chatroom you are in
- Add an edit message option
    - should toggle the msg bar to edit a message rather than send a new one
    - scroll to message edited
    - some indication letting user know what is being edited
    - highlight the msg being edited
- implement way to reply to messages (can just add "reply_to" field to a msg in db)
- implement way to store and access images (need to look into dropbox/any file storage api)
    - kind of optional but looks cool if we do it
- Hide the send message bar from users if not logged in
- Profile page letting the user edit their username
    - these should appear upon a button press
    - shouldn't be able to interact with anything else
- Add restrictions to the username and password in register form
    - username can't be admin (some authentication in the backend)
